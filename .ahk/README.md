Description
===

Key remap to navigate windows using AutoHotKey.

It deactivate the single keystroke for the Windows key (ðŸªŸ). This is because I use the key a lot, and when I click it but change my mind, I don't want to open the start menu. Also, this setup was made with a launcher in mind, mainly the Powertoy Run launcher.
